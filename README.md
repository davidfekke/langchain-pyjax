# Sample code and notebooks for PyJax Langchain Demo

In order to run the OpenAI examples, you will need an OpenAI API Key from OpenAI in order to run the examples. You can either replace the OPENAI_API_KEY in the code or set an environment variable for OPENAI_API_KEY.

## Virtual Environment

I recommend setting a virtual environment for running this project.

You can activate a virtual environment on a Mac or Linux with the following commands:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Once the environment is activated, you can install the following langchain packages:

```sh
pip install langchain_core
pip install langchain_openai
```
